        "abstract": "Green chemistry education has been the object of intensive attention, research and explorations in the last decades; environmental chemistry education has received alternating attention. Both green chemistry and environmental chemistry are concerned with the environment. Green chemistry focuses on pollution prevention at the source, to be pursued through changes in the production and handling of substances, as well as the nature of substances themselves, by envisaging the replacement of non-benign substances by more benign ones. Environmental chemistry focuses on the effects of pollutants, thus providing indications on the substances that require more urgent replacement and more effective measures to prevent them from entering the environment. At education level, it is important to acquaint students with the domain of these two areas, their possible synergies and the expected ensuing benefits. The present work outlines collaboration and convergence pathways, considering the green chemistry principles and also the complexity of the implementation features of pollution prevention. It is concluded that an educational approach bridging the two perspectives is crucial to make future chemists, as well as other professionals, more ready for the multidisciplinary requirements of sustainability discourses and their operational components"

        "abstract": "This mini-review highlights how many of the principles of green chemistry can be used to make polymers more sustainable. The use of renewable feedstocks has grown enormously in recent years including use of bio-derived monomers and modifications of natural polymers such as carbohydrates. Polymers are also being designed to allow entry into the circular economy especially where triggered depolymerization (e.g. catalytic recycling to monomer) can occur, which can allow easy separation from other plastics in a mixed waste stream. Computational studies and reaction monitoring are useful in identifying and understanding reactivity trends for polymer synthesis and degradation. Solvent-free reactions, including mechanochemistry, can be employed to reduce process mass intensity and environmental impacts. Use of standard polymer degradation conditions (e.g. ISO standards) and life cycle assessments, in particular hot spot analyses, should be encouraged in order to accelerate progress in this important field."

Herein, we develop a chemiluminescent biosensor based on enzymatic extension and click chemistry for sensitive measurement of MGMT activity. When MGMT is present, the MGMT-catalyzed demethylation reaction initiates the cleavage of biotinylated dumbbell probes by PvuII restrictive enzyme, releasing two DNA fragments with 3′-OH end. The resultant DNA fragments can trigger terminal transferase (TdT)- and click chemistry-assisted isothermal amplification to obtain abundant G-rich sequences. The G-rich sequences can be captured by magnetic beads to produce a high chemiluminescence signal. This biosensor can greatly amplify the chemiluminescence signal, facilitating label-free and template-free measurement of MGMT. Especially, the introduction of dumbbell probe and PvuII enzyme can efficiently eliminate the false positive and improve the assay specificity. This biosensor possesses high sensitivity with a detection limit of 1.4 × 10−9 ng/μL, and it may accurately quantify the intracellular MGMT. Importantly, this biosensor can be used to screen the MGMT inhibitors and distinguish the MGMT level in breast tumor tissues and normal tissues, with great potential in drug discovery and cancer diagnosis."

The prepared Ru/C catalysts were active, being activity and selectivity strongly dependent on the support surface chemistry. It was confirmed that the supported Ru species became reduced under reaction conditions, and this process was more efficient in catalysts prepared with the heat treated supports, due to the different interactions created between Ru species and the support surface. In a cleaner carbon surface, the anchorage of the Ru species on carbon oxygen groups was limited, and they were more prone to be reduced and to move, forming more defined metallic structures. The carbon surface chemistry determined the Ru speciation (reduced and oxidized species), and the proportion of reduced Ru drived the H spill over process, which was related to the creation of protonic acid sites, proposed to be key point to explain the trend in selectivity to GVL."

For the first time, experimentally determined polymerization yields were included in the calculation, by analyzing the polymer synthesis process using various organic solvents, different methods of regenerating the catalytic complex (meaning ATRP approach), or using the miniemulsion system as eco-friendly reaction medium and presenting the possibility of effective solvent recovery and reuse. The majority of the values of E-factor were below 16, falling within the scope intended for fine chemicals (5–50). The significant and innovative part of the presented research involves verifying the feasibility of using higher concentrations of the dispersed phase in the case of miniemulsion polymerization (increased to as much as 100 % vs. aqueous phase from a typical 20 %), while the use of recycled water allowed a 3-fold reduction in E-factor value. Polymerization in a miniemulsion environment is also attractive due to its low cost, considering the price of distilled water, which is over 580-fold lower than that of DMSO – a typical organic solvent. These observations allow for the reduction of environmental impact and process cost. Importantly, the observed trends in E-factor changes allowed for the identification of ATRP development directions in line with green chemistry and the circular economy."

Gaining insight into these bioinorganic processes is hampered by the biological complexity of plasma/red blood cells and the low concentrations of the metal(loid) species of interest, but can be overcome by employing LC techniques hyphenated to atomic spectroscopic detectors (i.e. metallomics techniques). This perspective aims to highlight the potential of unconventional hyphenated separation modes to advance our understanding of the bioinorganic chemistry of toxic metal(loid) species in the bloodstream-organ system. Four examples are illustrated. The application of anion-exchange (AEX) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) provided new insight into the blood-based bioinorganic mechanisms that direct Cd2+ and MeHg+ to target organs. AEX chromatography also allowed to observe the formation of complexes between Hg2+ and MeHg+ with L-cysteine at pH 7.4, that are implicated in their organ uptake. Lastly, the application of reversed phase (RP) chromatography revealed a possible cytosolic mechanism by which N-acetyl-L-cysteine binds to MeHg+ in the presence of cytosolic glutathione (GSH). New insight into other bioinorganic processes may advance the regulatory framework to better protect public health."

        "title": "Features and strategy influence performance on a chemistry spatial task",
        "abstract": "Spatial thinking is an important skill for success in the chemistry classroom. Experimental studies on mental rotation, a key skill for spatial thinking, show interesting trends in participant performance on 2D and 3D similarity judgement tasks. In these studies, participants’ use of mental rotation is determined by linear regression and/or correlations of response time versus angular disparity of the task. While judgements with block diagrams are amenable to mental rotation, studies find differences with the more symbolic 2D chemistry diagrams depending in the participants’ expertise: novices tend to use mental rotation, while experts use algorithms or other heuristics. Herein, we study these aspects chemistry, spatial thinking, and mental rotation, adding to prior work by investigating the effect of time limits and how task variables like axis and angular disparity influence task performance. We also incorporated a block design that allowed us to look for practice effects. This study was conducted online with undergraduate students (N = 162) and designed as a conceptual replication of Stieff et al. (2018) to explore how features of the task (e.g., axis of rotation) influence participants accuracy, response time, and their use of mental rotation, diagrammatic, analytic, or algorithmic strategies. Our results suggest that mental rotation was being used successfully for only z-axis rotations, with other strategies such as symmetry heuristics are likely being used for x- and y-axis rotations. We also found that practice can improve stereochemistry task performance. These findings support chemistry novices’ reliance on mental rotation but also suggest that alternative strategies are used when time is limited."

        "abstract": "This study evaluates the analysis of Mirabegron (MIR) and Solifenacin (SOL), widely used for treating overactive bladder (OAB), using two direct UPLC and spectrophotometric techniques. These methods were developed to be environmentally friendly, utilizing AGREE, GAPI, AGREEprep, ComplexGAPI, AMGS, ESA, HPLC-EAT, AMVI, and BAGI tools. Spectrophotometry, including the first derivative ratio spectrophotometric method (1DD), measures SOL and MIR at 224.8 nm and 258.6 nm, respectively. A method known as the extended ratio subtraction method (EXRSM) is used to resolve the overlap between the SOL and MIR. In this method, the binary mixture spectrum is divided by the divisor. A constant value is subtracted from the plateau region. MIR and SOL at λmax of 248.9 nm and 229.8 nm have a zero-order (D0) after being multiplied by a divisor. The MCR technique has successfully addressed the issue of spectral overlaps for SOL and MIR at 218.5 and 249.7 nm wavelengths. The second method, UPLC densitometry, separates pharmaceuticals using a UPLC C18 1.7 µm (2.1 × 50 mm) column with Ethanol: phosphate buffer pH 4.2 (35:65 v/v) mobile phase at a 0.6 ml/min flow rate, detecting drugs at 210 nm. Calibration curves for both techniques showed a correlation coefficient greater than 0.999 for SOL and MIR in the 1–65 µg mL−1, 1–60 µg mL−1, and 5–25 µg mL−1, respectively. The methods were validated according to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) principles. These techniques offer cost-effective, eco-friendly alternatives to traditional methods, promoting sustainability in analytical chemistry."

Consequently, it is crucial to develop sensitive and reliable detection technologies to ensure food safety. Notably, biosensing technologies have been widely applied in the analysis of food hazard factors due to their merits of portability, versatility, good sensitivity, rapid response, and reusability. To further improve the detection performance of biosensors, click chemistry has been successfully applied in the design and construction of biosensors because of its numerous advantages, such as moderate reaction conditions, high efficiency, no by-products, and accurate selectivity. In recent years, click chemistry-mediated biosensing platforms have obtained extensive applications in the area of food safety detection. By combining with portable analytical devices, the on-site detection of food hazard factors can be realized. In this review, we for the first time thoroughly summarized the recent advances on the click chemistry-based biosensing platform and portable analytical devices for food safety detection. First of all, the common click reactions and mechanisms involved in the construction of biosensors were introduced and discussed. Then, the design and construction of the biosensing platforms and portable analytical devices based on click chemistry were summarized, and their strengths and weaknesses were also discussed and summarized. Ultimately, attention was focused on the applications of click chemistry-enabled biosensing platforms and portable analytical devices in the detection of food hazard factors (e.g., pesticide residues, foodborne pathogens, mycotoxins, antibiotics, food allergic proteins, and heavy metal ions). Impressively, future obstacles and chances in the development and applications of click chemistry-based biosensing platforms were tentatively put forward."

The broad range of macrocycles available as well as their facile modification and, in some cases, the ability to act as hosts is leading to a growth in the use of macrocyclic metal-based agents against a number of common health issues as well as some of the lesser-known ailments. The focus here is mostly on the use of systems comprised of either calixarenes or cucurbiturils, but we also note some of the highlights that have emerged from the use of other metal-containing macrocyclic systems such as those based on pillarenes, cyclodextrins, crown ethers, and Schiff-base macrocycles. Much of the work is centered around improving the delivery and effectiveness of metal-containing anti-cancer drugs, particularly those based on platinum, however, there have also been advances in a number of other areas such as their use as agents against bacteria, TB or HIV. A significant body of work has also been conducted in conjunction with nanoparticles, where the surface of the nanoparticles has been modified with a view to subsequent use in medicine."

Moreover, traditional analytical methods generate hazardous waste, posing further environmental and health risks, conflicting with several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, such as reducing pollution and conserving ecosystems. In response to these environmental challenges, the concept of green analytical chemistry emerged promoting environmentally friendly practices through principles such as reducing chemical use, minimizing energy consumption, and managing waste. Various green metric tools have been developed to assess the environmental impact of analytical methods, but these often neglect the reliability and applicability of the methods. To address this gap, approaches like White Analytical Chemistry (WAC) have been proposed, integrating criteria for environmental safety, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. WAC's principles are categorized into red (fitness for purpose), green (environmental safety), and blue (cost-efficiency) criteria.This study aims to use the WAC approach to provide a holistic comparison of different medicines' quality screening devices, helping developing countries with high SF medicine prevalence make informed choices. Three different situations are investigated: ex-ante evaluation, ex-post evaluation of the qualitative performances and ex-post evaluation of the quantitative performances of the most used medicines’ quality screening devices in low- and middle-income countries field settings."
